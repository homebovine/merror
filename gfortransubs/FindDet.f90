!Function to find the determinant of a square matrix
!Author : Louisda16th a.k.a Ashwith J. Rego
!Description: The subroutine is based on two key points:
!1] A determinant is unaltered when row operations are performed: Hence, using this principle,
!row operations (column operations would work as well) are used
!to convert the matrix into upper traingular form
!2]The determinant of a triangular matrix is obtained by finding the product of the diagonal elements
